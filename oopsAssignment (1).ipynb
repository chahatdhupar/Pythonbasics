        " 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        " -> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses \"objects\" to represent data and methods to manipulate that data. In Python, OOP allows developers to create classes that define the properties and behaviors of objects\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "->In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class can use. Classes encapsulate data for the object and provide a way to manipulate that data through methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "->In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity that has its own state (data) and behavior (methods) defined by the class from which it is created. Objects are the fundamental building blocks of OOP, allowing developers to model real-world entities and their interactions in a structured way.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "->Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the essential features to the user. It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it. On the other hand,\n",
        "Encapsulation is the concept of bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which is a means of preventing unintended interference and misuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "->Dunder methods, short for \"double underscore\" methods, are special methods in Python that have names starting and ending with double underscores (e.g., __init__, __str__, __add__). These methods are also known as \"magic methods\" or \"special methods.\" They allow you to define the behavior of your objects for built-in operations and functions, enabling a more intuitive and Pythonic way to interact with your custom classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "->nheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a new class (known as a derived or child class) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (known as a base or parent class). This mechanism promotes code reusability, establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes, and allows for the creation of more specialized classes based on general ones.\n",
        "Key Features of Inheritance:\n",
        " - Code Reusability:\n",
        " - Hierarchical Relationships:\n",
        " - Method Overriding:\n",

        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "->Polymorphism is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types). The term \"polymorphism\" means \"many shapes\" and refers to the ability of different classes to provide a unique implementation of methods that share the same name.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "->Encapsulation in Python is achieved through the use of public, protected, and private access modifiers:\n",
        "\n",
        "Public: Attributes and methods are accessible from outside the class.\n",
        "Protected: Attributes and methods are intended for internal use and should not be accessed directly outside the class or its subclasses (indicated by a single underscore).\n",
        "Private: Attributes and methods are intended to be hidden from outside access (indicated by a double underscore), and Python uses name mangling to enforce this.\n",
        "Encapsulation helps in protecting the internal state of an object, maintaining data integrity, and providing a clear interface for interacting with the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "->In Python, a constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an instance (object) of a class is created. The primary purpose of a constructor is to initialize the attributes of the new object and set up any necessary state. In Python, the constructor method is defined using the __init__ method.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "->A class method is a method that is bound to the class rather than its instance. It can modify class state that applies across all instances of the class.Class methods are defined using the @classmethod decorator.The first parameter of a class method is typically named cls, which refers to the class itself, not the instance.Example:\n",

        "print(Dog.get_species())  # Outputs: Canis lupus familiaris\n",
        "\n",
        "A static method is a method that does not modify class or instance state. It behaves like a regular function but belongs to the class's namespace. Static methods do not take self or cls as the first parameter.Static methods are defined using the @staticmethod decorator.Static methods are used when you want to perform some operation that is related to the class but does not need access to class or instance attributes. Example:\n",

        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "->Method overloading is a programming concept that allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (i.e., different signatures). This enables the same method name to perform different tasks based on the input arguments. However, it's important to note that Python does not support traditional method overloading as seen in some other programming languages (like Java or C++). Instead, Python achieves similar functionality through default arguments, variable-length arguments, and type checking within a single method.\n",

        "\n",
        "->Method overriding occurs when a subclass defines a method with the same name as a method in the parent class. The child’s version replaces the parent’s during runtime.\n",

        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> The property decorator is a built-in decorator that allows you to define methods in a class that can be accessed like attributes. It provides a way to manage the access to an attribute by defining getter, setter, and deleter methods, which can encapsulate the logic for getting, setting, and deleting an attribute's value. This is useful for implementing encapsulation and data validation.\n",

        "\n",
        "->Polymorphism is important in OOP because it promotes code reusability, flexibility, and maintainability. It allows for dynamic method resolution, improves code organization, and simplifies interfaces, making it easier to work with different types of objects in a consistent manner. By leveraging polymorphism, developers can create more robust and adaptable software systems.\n",
